        Then press `Tab` and hit `Enter` to "OK".

    6. Now, configuring phpmyadmin dialog box will appear and select ‘yes’ after that give the password in my case it’s  ‘admin’ 
        This 'admin' password is of the root password.

    7. Now, goto the php directory as:-

        ==> nano info.php

        after that type the code as:-

            ?>

	    And press `ctrl + o` to `write/save` & press 'enter' and `ctrl + x` to exit.

    10. Now goto the browser and type ‘localhost/info.php’ you will get the php version.

    11. The in browser go to the ‘localhost/phpmyadmin’ you will have to login now.

    so, to create user `name` and `password` at first type following command in terminal:

        Now, u will be inside the 'mysql' connection editor.

    12. Create User using command as:-
        ==> CREATE USER 'admin'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'admin';

	    It means that the user name is ‘admin’ and password is also ‘admin’.


    13. Grant Permission using the command as:-
        ==> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'admin'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;


        Now, u can exit from the mysql connection editor.


    Wallah !
